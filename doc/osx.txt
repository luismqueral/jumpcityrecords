Installing software for running jumpcity on OSX Yosemite:

A word of warning: this will override the Apple-supplied version of Python with the 2.7.8 that Homebrew supplies, at least in Terminal sessions. I don't know what other consequences this causes, but as far as I can see, everything works as usual.

I used a fresh install of Yosemite on an external USB disk to test out the following:

- install Xcode, via the AppStore
- visit http://brew.sh, scroll down, copy the install command and paste and run it in a Terminal.
$ brew update
$ brew install opencore-amr libvorbis flac libsndfile libao lame ffmpeg
$ brew install sox
$ sox -n test.wav synth 440 fade 0 2 1
$ play test.wav

$ python -V
$ brew install python
$ brew linkapps
$ exit

- start Terminal again
$ python -V

- visit https://xquartz.macosforge.org, download the DMG, open it, run the package installer
- log out
- log in
- install the fonts 'Apercu' and 'Transport Medium' (not part of the jumpcity repository; the software will run OK without these fonts)
- open a Terminal
$ brew install py2cairo
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords.git
$ cd jumpcityrecords/src
$ python albumart.py
$ open output/*
$ mkdir ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums
$ mkdir ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums/Samples
- place at least 5 audio samples (with the audio format mp3, wav, aiff or flac) in the ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums/Samples folder.
$ python jumpcity.py
- see if it works. Feel free to Control-C after a while.

- install Gtk3+ as follows:
$ cd ~/jumpcityrecords/src
$ brew install pygobject3 gtk+3
$ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ cp /usr/local/Cellar/d-bus/1.8.8/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
$ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
$ python randomdraw.py  (could take some time, XQuartz has to start too)
- resize the app window to refresh the album art

This app will restore Lucida Grande as the system font on Yosemite. If you like the older look of OSX, or, in my case, I have a pretty old iMac and the screen isn't suited well for Helvetica Neue.
