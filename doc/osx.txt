Installing software for running jumpcity on OSX Yosemite:

A word of warning: this will override the Apple-supplied version of Python with the 2.7.8 that Homebrew supplies, at least in Terminal sessions. I don't know what other consequences this causes, but as far as I can see, everything works as usual.

I used a fresh install of Yosemite on an external USB disk to test out the following:

- install Xcode, via the AppStore
- visit http://brew.sh, scroll down, copy the install command and paste and run it in a Terminal.
$ brew update
$ brew install opencore-amr libvorbis flac libsndfile libao lame ffmpeg
$ brew install sox
$ sox -n test.wav synth 440 fade 0 2 1
$ play test.wav

$ python -V
$ brew install python
$ brew linkapps
$ exit

- start Terminal again
$ python -V

- visit https://xquartz.macosforge.org, download the DMG, open it, run the package installer
- log out
- log in
- install the fonts 'Apercu' and 'Transport Medium' (not part of the jumpcity repository; the software will run OK without these fonts)
- open a Terminal
$ brew install py2cairo
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords.git
$ cd jumpcityrecords/src
$ python albumart.py
$ open output/*
$ mkdir ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums
$ mkdir ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums/Samples
- place at least 5 audio samples (with the audio format mp3, wav, aiff or flac) in the ~/jumpcityrecords/_albums/Samples folder.
$ python jumpcity.py
- Done

TODO: Describe installing Gtk3, so that randomdraw.py can be run.

TIP: Download http://goo.gl/nKqPvM. Not necessary, but this app will restore Lucida Grande as the system font on Yosemite. If you like the older look of OSX, or, in my case, I have a pretty old iMac and the screen isn't suited well for Helvetica Neue.
